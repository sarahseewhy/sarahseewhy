Side project to build a website using javascript and experimenting with various
tutorials.

Ensure all necessary packages are installed on machine in use.

Use `npm run dev` to fire up the app.

### Phase I

I started by following this tutorial: ["Building a simple CRUD application with
Express andMongoDB"](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/), mainly to
get my head back into JS.

I recommend it as a tutorial; the instructions are clear and concise. The only
thing I missed was a guide to test-driving the tutorial.

### Phase II

I'd like to practice and review some core HTML and CSS skills by generating a
static website, no bells or whistles functionality.

I enjoyed Zell's previous tutorial, especially the writing style and clear
instructions so I started there.

### Phase III

Play around with different frameworks. Choose one and stick with it.

### Phase IV

Add bells and whistles to a vanilla website project. I've found
a few interesting tutorials for building a CRUD operation in JS guided by tests.

Ideally this will become a blog platform for me to use.
